            rights, which you can exercise at any time by contacting the data
            controller mentioned in section 1 of this privacy policy: Right of
            Access: You have the right to request information about whether and
            which data we process about you. Right to Rectification: You have
            the right to request the correction of inaccurate or incomplete
            data. Right to Erasure: You have the right to request the deletion
            of your data. Right to Restriction: In certain cases, you have the
            right to request that we restrict the processing of your data. Right
            to Data Portability: You have the right to request that we transfer
            your data to you or another controller in a structured, commonly
            used, and machine-readable format. Right to Lodge a Complaint: You
            have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
